    In March, my supervisor and I were invited to present our work at the AAAI Spring symposium series hosted at Stanford University, USA. The campus and surrounds are very impressive; its easy to see why Silicon Valley is located around the Bay area. As for the symposium, it was a great experience and we received very positive feedback from the delegates.
